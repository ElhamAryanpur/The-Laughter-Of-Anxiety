# Chapter 1: The Start

 Once upon a time not far away in a galaxy that we start today, there was a young collage student in a city, codename C137, by name of Tom. He was called the `Sad Reaper` on the internet, as he was a hacktivist; seeking justice for the smile of citizens was his hobby. Tho the young age equalizer of small experience, he thought of life being simple and world being ant. But we know what happen to humans that doesn't pass the road of second thought.

Damn. This should be enough about me! Maybe not... why am I procrastinating? I can do better than this... I'll just, hit the bed I guess I'm tired.

OH FOR GOD'S SAKE! WHY this neighbor is not shutting up? It's 1 am and they're still fighting! I guess I gotta deal with you people later too, since you won't just SHUT THE HELL UP! Tho come to think of it, I just bought this new headphone, probably a good time to sleep with some LoFi beats.

.

God... Morning Already? Why the sun is so bright in this winter days. Nothing makes sense anymore... Being an owl is playing with mind I think. Oh, my favorite car just passed...

I... I love that... The black tires, the dark paint, looks like 2010 sport car but for mafia... It's... So... Cool! What's not cool is me being broke, why my salary ain't raising from 10k? I work full-time and still low...

Come to think of it, I wanna start doing freelancing. Might get some extra bucks this way since my PC need some new parts as well. Ah well, let's see what will happen.

.

Work hours again. Whyyyy this is soooo boringggg? Why nobody is attacking us... Being safe is so boring...

.

Finally! Work is done! Happy! OH SHOOT MY CLASSES ARE STARTING! I gotta get there fast!

.

Oh Phew! I missed only my least favorite class. Goodie! Oh wow, for the first time, Katy is absent. This day sure can't get more weird! Oh. Hardware topic teacher came bringing an old IBM computer with him. OH I JUST REMEMBERED! Today is old day of the week.

Basically it's a day where we learn about older techs and how they overcome the challenges! Today I think is about COBOL language. Personally I am not a fan of old stuff, P.S. who will need this old stuff since everything is so modern and advanced am I right?

Or not... Next week is exams... I guess I gotta learn it anyways...

On the other hand, this competition is starting too! The prize pool is 200k! It is about breaking 5 security walls and get hidden codes. Person who break all 5 first, will win 100k alone!

Tho... few passed 3rd wall and none before passed 4th... There are some rumors on only 1 person being able to make it to 5th wall, don't know... Which is a good thing! Since breaking walls is what I eat at lunch baby! I am confident I can do it!
